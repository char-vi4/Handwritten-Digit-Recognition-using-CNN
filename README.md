# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN
With the introduction of Artificial Intelligence, the computational power of computers has increased. Now, computers can make decisions with noisy data and do many similar human tasks. Character recognition is also one of them. Computers are now learning to recognize handwritten characters. 
  Handwritten character recognition is one of the practically important issues in pattern recognition applications. The applications of digit recognition include postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry, etc.

For training and testig purposes, this system uses MNIST dataset from Tensorflow Keras. The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits in the 28 * 28-pixel format. Each digit has a label according to its value.

MNIST Dataset can be imported into the notebook.
